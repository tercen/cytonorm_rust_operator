# cytonorm_rust_operator

Batch normalisation for cytometry in Tercen. Rust port of
[`cytonormpy`](https://github.com/TarikExner/cytonormpy) 1.0.2, configured the way the
CYTOSHRINK comparison runs configure it.

## What it does

For each batch, cluster and channel, it takes the quantiles of the **batch controls**, averages
those quantiles across batches to form a goal, fits a monotone spline from each batch onto that
goal, and applies it to every cell of the batch. Batch effects move a distribution; the spline
moves it back.

## Input

The projection follows the R [`cytonorm_operator`](https://github.com/tercen/cytonorm_operator),
so a workflow can swap one for the other:

| | |
|---|---|
| rows | channel |
| columns | cell, and the factors below |
| colours | batch |
| labels | type, where `Train` marks a batch control |
| y | the value, usually already arcsinh transformed |

The batch and type can also be named directly with `batch_factor` and `type_factor`, which is
useful when they are plain column factors.

## Properties

| Name | Default | Description |
|---|---:|---|
| `cluster` | 1 | FlowSOM clusters. **Only 1 is supported**: this version does not cluster. |
| `cluster_factor` | *(none)* | Column factor holding a cluster label per cell, e.g. from the FlowSOM operator. |
| `number_of_cells` | 6000 | Reference cells sampled per group to fit; 0 uses all of them. |
| `n_quantiles` | 99 | 99 is what the reference runs use; cytonormpy's notebook default is 101. |
| `min_cells` | 101 | Below this a group is passed through unchanged. |
| `seed` | 1 | Seed for the subsample, so a fit repeats. |
| `reference_value` | `Train` | The value in the type factor that marks a batch control. |
| `collect_max_cells` | 20000000 | Above this the result is streamed rather than buffered. |

## Output

One column, `<namespace>.cytonorm`, one value per cell.

## Parity

`cargo test` reproduces cytonormpy on committed synthetic fixtures: **quantiles and goal exactly**,
and normalised values to **2e-13** over 144,000 values. The same comparison run through a Tercen
instance — projection, operator, server, export — gives the same 2e-13.

The reference configuration matters. cytonormpy's default spline tangents overshoot, and the
runs this port targets replace them with PCHIP tangents and slope-1 extrapolation; reproducing
the library's defaults would not reproduce the study.

## Not here yet

The self-organising map. Clustering comes in as a factor, or there is one cluster, which is
CytoNorm without clustering and a legitimate configuration in its own right.
